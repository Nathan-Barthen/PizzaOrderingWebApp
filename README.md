This Java project utilizes the Spring MVC and Maven framework, along with Thymeleaf for seamless integration of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It employs JSON databases for local data storage. 
     The project itself is an online ordering application designed specifically for a pizza store. The website serves as a centralized platform where users can create accounts, log in, 
and conveniently add items from the menu to their cart. The app offers customization options for ingredient preferences, as well as the ability to edit the cart before proceeding to checkout and order submission. 
Users can access their order history, review past orders, and modify their account information. Additionally, the system incorporates an admin feature, granting special privileges to designated users. 
Admins gain access to admin-specific pages, enabling them to manage the menu by adding, editing, or deleting items. They can also oversee user accounts, granting or revoking admin privileges, 
as well as deleting accounts when necessary. Overall, this project provides an efficient and user-friendly online ordering solution tailored to the needs of a pizza store.
